# docker-42norminette

Based on the script and dump from [42_norminette](https://github.com/veroxy/42_norminette).
Some urls were dead :skull: and you have to figure out the dependencies by yourself.
Huge thanks to [veroxy](https://github.com/veroxy) and the mystery man make this bloated rubinius work :clap: 

## NO MERCY ! Run the official 42 norminette on any system without headache. 

```bash
docker pull mrdotb/42norminette
```
